Abstract 
Mandatory job rotations are a cornerstone of the Malaysian civil service, designed to enhance governance, reduce 
integrity risks, and foster organizational agility. However, these rotations present significant onboarding challenges, requiring 
employees to rapidly adapt to diverse roles and complex responsibilities, particularly in 'hot seat' and high-risk-to-corruption 
positions. This study focuses on the Jabatan Kastam Diraja Malaysia (JKDM), where the need for efficient onboarding is 
heightened by the structured tenure of job rotations. The necessity to quickly acclimate to new roles within a defined period, 
especially in sensitive positions, underscores the urgency of effective onboarding strategies. To address the inherent 
onboarding complexities, particularly in navigating intricate customs regulations, this research proposes leveraging Large 
Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on NotebookLM. NotebookLM's ability to ingest and summarize extensive 
regulatory documents, coupled with features like interactive training modules and AI-powered Q&A, offers a dynamic, 
personalized learning experience. This approach aims to surpass traditional training limitations, streamlining onboarding, 
enhancing knowledge transfer, and boosting productivity within JKDM. The study outlines an implementation plan, including 
a pilot program and department-wide rollout, with expected outcomes of improved onboarding efficiency, enhanced 
knowledge sharing, and increased operational effectiveness, ultimately contributing to a more agile and integrity-driven public 
service.

1. 
Introduction 
The Malaysian public sector plays a crucial role in the country's economy and governance, employing a significant 
portion of the workforce and providing essential services to citizens (Malaysian Administrative Modernization and 
Management Planning Unit, 2010). As of 2024, the public sector employed approximately 1.6 million civil servants, 
highlighting its size and importance in Malaysia's socio-economic development (Prime Minister's Office of Malaysia, 2024). 
The sector encompasses a wide range of services, including healthcare, education, infrastructure development, and social 
welfare programs, all of which are vital for the well-being of Malaysian citizens (Economic Planning Unit, 2010). 
Within this large and complex sector, job rotation is a common practice aimed at enhancing employee development, 
facilitating knowledge sharing, and enabling cross-training across different government agencies and departments (Bauer & 
Erdogan, 2011; Campion, Cheraskin, & Stevens, 1994). The Public Service Department (JPA) provides a general framework 
for job rotation, emphasizing its role in talent management and career development (Jabatan Perkhidmatan Awam, 2015). The 
frequency, duration, and selection process for job rotations vary depending on the specific agency and position, allowing for 
flexibility and customization based on organization needs and circumstances (Jabatan Perkhidmatan Awam, 2015). This 
approach to talent management is designed to foster a versatile and well-rounded workforce capable of adapting to the evolving 
needs of the public sector (Jabatan Perkhidmatan Awam, 2018). 
Despite the benefits of job rotation, civil servants often encounter challenges during the onboarding process, 
particularly when adapting to new roles, responsibilities, and organizational cultures (Bauer & Erdogan, 2011). These 
challenges can hinder their ability to quickly integrate and contribute effectively to their new positions (Noe et al., 2017). One 
major challenge is information overload, where the sheer volume of documents, regulations, and procedures to learn can be 
overwhelming, especially when transitioning to a new agency or department with its own unique set of rules and practices 
(Noe et al., 2017). This overload can lead to confusion and frustration, slowing down the onboarding process and impacting 
employee performance (Bauer & Erdogan, 2011). 
Furthermore, varied procedures across different agencies and departments pose a significant hurdle for employees 
undergoing job rotation (Noe et al., 2017). Each agency may have its own specific workflows, documentation styles, and 
approval processes, requiring employees to constantly adjust and relearn how to perform tasks (Noe et al., 2017). This 
inconsistency can lead to delays, errors, and a sense of disorientation, particularly for those new to the agency or department 
(Bauer & Erdogan, 2011). In addition to procedural variations, knowledge gaps can also present challenges during onboarding 
(Noe et al., 2017). Identifying and addressing these gaps efficiently can be difficult, especially when transitioning to a role that 
requires specialized expertise or knowledge of specific regulations and policies (Campion et al., 1994). 
The limited time available for onboarding further exacerbates these challenges. Time constraints due to the demands 
of public service delivery often mean that employees have to quickly get up to speed in their new roles (Noe et al., 2017). This 
pressure can limit the depth of training and support provided, potentially leaving employees feeling unprepared and hindering 
their ability to perform their duties effectively (Bauer & Erdogan, 2011). Finally, inconsistent onboarding experiences across 
agencies and departments can create disparities in employee preparedness and performance (Noe et al., 2017). Some agencies 
may have well-structured onboarding programs with comprehensive training and support, while others may have more ad hoc 
approaches, leading to variations in the quality and effectiveness of the onboarding process (Bauer & Erdogan, 2011). This 
inconsistency can affect employee morale, productivity, and overall job satisfaction (Noe et al., 2017). 
This research focuses specifically on the JKDM, also known as the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, as a case 
study to demonstrate the potential of NotebookLM in addressing the challenges of job rotation onboarding. JKDM is a 
particularly relevant case for several reasons. First, JKDM officers operate in a high-risk environment where corruption is a 
significant concern.  The mandatory rotation of officers, especially those in "hot seat" and sensitive positions, necessitates 
rapid and effective onboarding to ensure compliance and minimize vulnerabilities. Second, JKDM deals with a vast and 
complex body of customs regulations, requiring officers to possess a thorough understanding of various laws, tariffs, and 
procedures. This complexity can be overwhelming for officers transitioning to different roles within JKDM, especially under 
the time constraints of structured tenure. Third, JKDM has a wide range of roles and responsibilities, from enforcement and 
valuation to investigation and intelligence.  Each role demands specialized knowledge and skills, and officers undergoing job 
rotation must quickly adapt to these new demands. Finally, the trade environment is dynamic and constantly evolving, with 
frequent updates and amendments to customs regulations and international trade agreements. This necessitates continuous 
learning and adaptation for JKDM officers to stay abreast of the latest developments. The challenges faced by JKDM officers 
during job rotation onboarding are representative of the broader challenges faced by civil servants across various agencies and 
departments in the Malaysian public sector. Therefore, the successful implementation of Large Language Model within JKDM 
can serve as a model for other agencies seeking to improve their onboarding processes, enhance knowledge transfer, and 
promote integrity within their workforce.

Problem Statement 
The challenges faced by Malaysian civil servants during job rotation onboarding are multifaceted and deeply ingrained 
in the structure and practices of the public sector. One prominent challenge is the varied agency procedures across different 
government bodies (Noe et al., 2017). For instance, document formats, approval processes, and communication protocols can 
differ significantly between agencies, creating confusion and hindering smooth transitions for employees (Noe et al., 2017). 
This lack of standardization necessitates that employees relearn processes with each rotation, leading to inefficiencies and 
potential delays in service delivery (Bauer & Erdogan, 2011). 
Another significant issue is documentation accessibility. Currently, essential documents like regulations, circulars, and 
guidelines are often scattered across various platforms, including physical files, internal websites, and shared drives (Ismail & 
Ahmad, 2012; Yusoff & Hassan, 2010). This fragmented system makes it difficult for employees to locate the necessary 
information quickly and efficiently, especially during onboarding when they are unfamiliar with the agency's knowledge 
repositories (Awang & Ahmad, 2009). Moreover, outdated versions of documents may persist, leading to potential errors and 
inconsistencies in work processes (Davenport & Prusak, 1998). 
Traditional onboarding methods often prove ineffective in ensuring knowledge retention. Passive learning approaches, 
such as lectures or reading materials, may not fully engage employees or provide opportunities for practical application of 
knowledge (Chen et al., 2021). This can result in superficial understanding and difficulty in applying learned information to 
real-world scenarios (Hwang et al., 2020). Furthermore, limited opportunities for interaction and knowledge sharing can hinder 
the development of a deeper understanding and the ability to retain information long-term (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). 
Time constraints pose a significant obstacle to effective onboarding. The demanding nature of public service delivery 
often leaves limited time for comprehensive training and knowledge transfer (Noe et al., 2017). Employees are expected to 
quickly integrate into their new roles and contribute to the agency's operations, leaving little room for in-depth learning and 
development (Bauer & Erdogan, 2011). This pressure to perform can lead to a superficial understanding of job responsibilities 
and a reliance on "learning on the job," which may not always be the most efficient or effective approach (Campion et al., 
1994). 
Standardizing best practices across different agencies is crucial for improving overall public sector performance, but 
it presents significant challenges (Andriopoulos & Lowe, 2017; Gil-Garcia & Pardo, 2017). Communication barriers, lack of 
a centralized platform for knowledge sharing, and varying levels of commitment to adopting best practices can hinder their 
dissemination and implementation (OECD, 2019). This can lead to inconsistencies in service delivery and hinder the public 
sector's ability to adapt and improve its operations (Dunleavy et al., 2006). 
Finally, the need to identify level of digital literacy among some government servants poses a challenge for 
implementing technology-driven solutions like Large Language Model. While the Malaysian government is actively 
promoting digital transformation, the level of digital literacy varies across individuals and agencies (Ting, Osman, & Ting, 
2016). This disparity can create a digital divide, where some employees may struggle to utilize the full potential of digital 
tools, hindering the effectiveness of technology-driven initiatives (Said, Alam, & Zainuddin, 2016). 

Figure 3:  Visualization of Onboarding Process with Large Language Model 
Within the broader context of the Malaysian public sector, the JKDM faces unique challenges related to job rotation 
onboarding. One of the most significant challenges is the sheer volume and complexity of customs regulations (Zakaria & 
Ahmad, 2021). JKDM officers must be well-versed in a vast array of laws, tariffs, and procedures, including the Customs Act 
1967, the Excise Act 1976, Sales Tax Act 2018, Service Tax Act 2018, and various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). These 
regulations are often complex and subject to frequent amendments, making it challenging for officers to quickly grasp and 
apply them in their daily work (Yusoff & Hassan, 2019). For example, the classification of goods for import and export duties 
can be highly intricate, requiring officers to have a deep understanding of tariff codes and their interpretations (Rahman & 
Ahmad, 2017). 
Another challenge stems from the diverse roles within JKDM. The department comprises various units and divisions, 
each with specific responsibilities and expertise. For example, the Enforcement Division focuses on preventing smuggling and 
other customs offences, while the Valuation and Classification Division determines the value and tariff classification of goods. 
Each role requires a distinct set of knowledge and skills, making it challenging for officers to transition seamlessly between 
different areas of the department (Yusoff & Hassan, 2019). An officer moving from enforcement to valuation, for instance, 
would need to acquire new knowledge on valuation methods, customs procedures, and relevant legislation (Zakaria & Ahmad, 
2021). 
Furthermore, keeping up-to-date with changes in customs regulations and international trade poses a significant 
challenge for JKDM (Omar & Hassan, 2019). The dynamic nature of global trade means that customs procedures, tariffs, and 
agreements are constantly evolving (Al-Shboul, Abdallah, & Abdallah, 2021). JKDM officers need to be aware of these 
changes to ensure compliance and effective enforcement of regulations (Nawi & Salleh, 2021). This requires continuous 
learning and access to updated information, which can be challenging to achieve through traditional training methods and 
knowledge dissemination channels (Hussin & Said, 2020). For example, changes in FTA regulations or the introduction of 
new technologies or application for customs processes require officers to update their knowledge and skills promptly (Sidek 
& Abdullah, 2018). 
This research explores the challenges faced by Malaysian civil servants during job rotation onboarding, particularly 
the information overload and procedural variations across agencies.  The research uses the JKDM as a case study, highlighting 
the complexities of customs regulations and the diverse roles within the department.  The proposed solution is NotebookLM, 
a large language model (LLM), to create a centralized knowledge repository, interactive training modules, and AI-powered 

Q&A system.  The implementation process includes a pilot program and department-wide rollout.  Expected outcomes include 
improved onboarding efficiency, enhanced knowledge sharing, and increased productivity.     
Given that NotebookLM is a complimentary addition to the Malaysian government's Google Workspace package, the 
cost-benefit analysis should be revisited.  The acquisition cost of NotebookLM is eliminated, making implementation more 
attractive financially.  Financial objections would likely be minimized, but other sources of resistance, such as unfamiliarity 
with AI or fear of job displacement, still need to be addressed.  The implementation strategy might focus more on training, 
support, and integration with existing systems, rather than on budgeting and procurement processes.     
Successful integration of NotebookLM into the Malaysian public sector requires a nuanced understanding of its 
capabilities and the specific challenges it presents. Rather than merely acknowledging potential obstacles, the research must 
delve into the practical implications of implementing this AI-driven knowledge synthesis tool. Critically, ensuring accurate 
and ethical information processing is paramount; the research must evaluate the platform's ability to handle Bahasa Malaysia 
and diverse document types prevalent in government workflows, while mitigating the risk of AI-generated misinformation or 
biased interpretations, thus ensuring alignment with government policy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, the research 
should explore how to facilitate seamless human-AI collaboration, focusing on training programs that empower users to 
leverage the platform's capabilities while maintaining critical thinking and contextual awareness, thereby bridging the human-
AI collaboration gap.  
Given the sensitive nature of government data, data security and confidentiality are paramount, necessitating an 
investigation into how NotebookLM handles and protects sensitive information, ensuring compliance with Malaysian data 
privacy laws and regulations. To demonstrate the value of NotebookLM, the research must develop a robust evaluation 
framework that measures its impact on efficiency and decision-making, assessing how the platform streamlines information 
processing, enhances knowledge management, and supports evidence-based policy formulation. Finally, implementation 
success depends on how well NotebookLM integrates with existing government workflows and systems; the research should 
examine the technical and organizational aspects of integration, including data interoperability, system compatibility, and user 
adoption, developing strategies to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition. By focusing on these specific aspects, 
the research will provide a targeted and actionable analysis of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing 
NotebookLM in the Malaysian public sector, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions for its successful and 
responsible adoption.

their digital literacy level. Moreover, it could build digital confidence, encouraging employees to embrace and effectively 
leverage technology in their daily work. 
To promote inclusivity and broad accessibility, technology solutions can incorporate multilingual support.  Offering a 
Bahasa Melayu interface, as seen in platforms like NotebookLM, is one example. This vital multilingual feature can allow 
employees to engage with the platform in their preferred language, potentially enhancing comfort and comprehension. 
Crucially, multilingual approaches can support inclusivity, enabling personnel, regardless of linguistic preference, to more 
easily access and benefit from the platform. A Bahasa Melayu interface may increase accessibility for employees less proficient 
in English and reflect a commitment to respecting the diverse linguistic landscape of the Malaysian public sector. 
To address JKDM's specific operational needs, technology solutions can be designed for integration with the 
department’s existing digital infrastructure. Integration with iPatuh, JKDM’s internal platform, serves as a prime example. By 
connecting iPatuh and a platform like NotebookLM via integration method for example API integration, data connectors, 
JKDM officers could gain unified access to critical information within a single interface. This streamlined access to vital 
resources may help ensure officers more consistently work with current regulations and procedures, potentially enhancing 
efficiency and mitigating risks associated with outdated information and potential errors. This centralized knowledge 
repository could contribute to greater consistency in decision-making, potentially equipping officers to more effectively 
navigate customs operations. 
This comprehensive approach to technology implementation within JKDM suggests its potential to address 
department-specific challenges and enhance workforce capabilities.  By offering tailored features and leveraging AI, platforms 
like NotebookLM can contribute to improving the onboarding experience, potentially empowering JKDM officers and 
supporting a more efficient and effective customs administration.

this, comprehensive training and transparent communication are crucial. Training should be hands-on and demonstrate the 
platform's benefits, such as how NotebookLM Plus can simplify tasks and improve efficiency. Transparent communication 
should address concerns openly, perhaps through town hall meetings or online forums where employees can ask questions and 
receive honest answers. A phased rollout can allow employees to adapt gradually, starting with a small group of early adopters 
who can then champion the platform to their colleagues. 
Another challenge is the varying levels of digital literacy among government servants. A recent survey might reveal 
that a significant percentage of employee’s lack confidence in using digital tools or have limited experience with online 
learning platforms. To address this, digital literacy assessments and targeted training programs should be implemented. These 
programs could focus on building essential digital skills, such as navigating online interfaces, using search functions 
effectively, and collaborating on shared documents. Ongoing support through help desks, online resources, and community 
forums can aid employees who encounter difficulties or have further questions. Designing NotebookLM with a user-friendly 
interface, incorporating clear instructions and intuitive navigation, can also accommodate varying digital literacy levels. 
Data privacy concerns are also important to address. A thorough review of existing data privacy policies might reveal 
potential vulnerabilities related to the storage and access of sensitive information within NotebookLM Plus. Safeguards like 
data encryption and access controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access and ensure compliance with 
regulations like the Personal Data Protection Act 2010. Data privacy policies should be clearly communicated to foster trust, 
perhaps through easily accessible online documentation or mandatory training modules. Compliance with relevant regulations 
is essential to maintain public confidence and avoid potential legal issues.
